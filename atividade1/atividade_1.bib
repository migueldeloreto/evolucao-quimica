	abstract = {Until recently, infrared observations of exoplanetary atmospheres have typically been interpreted using models that assumed solar elemental abundances. With the chemical composition fixed, attempts have been made to classify hot Jupiter atmospheres on the basis of stellar irradiation. However, recent observations have revealed deviations from predictions based on such classification schemes, and chemical compositions retrieved from some data sets have also indicated non-solar abundances. The data require a two-dimensional (2D) characterization scheme with dependence on both irradiation and chemistry. In this work, we suggest the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio as an important second dimension for characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres. In hot-hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, the C/O ratio critically influences the relative concentrations of several spectroscopically dominant species. Between a C/O of 0.5 (solar value) and 2, the H2O and CH4 abundances can vary by several orders of magnitude in the observable atmosphere, and new hydrocarbon species such as HCN and C2H2 become prominent for C/O {\textgreater}= 1, while the CO abundance remains almost unchanged. Furthermore, a C/O {\textgreater}= 1 can preclude a strong thermal inversion due to TiO and VO in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally underabundant for C/O {\textgreater}= 1. We, therefore, suggest a new 2D classification scheme for hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with irradiation (or temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions. We define four classes in this 2D space (O1, O2, C1, and C2) with distinct chemical, thermal, and spectral properties. Based on the most recent observations, we characterize the thermal structure and C/O ratios of six hot Jupiters (XO-1b, CoRoT-2b, WASP-14b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b, and WASP-12b) in the framework of our proposed 2D classification scheme. While the data for several systems in our sample are consistent with C-rich atmospheres, new observations are required to conclusively constrain their C/O ratios in the day side as well as the terminator regions of their atmospheres. We discuss how observations using existing and forthcoming facilities can constrain C/O ratios in exoplanetary atmospheres.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The chemical composition of the Sun is a fundamental yardstick in astronomy, relative to which essentially all cosmic objects are referenced. As such, having accurate knowledge of the solar elemental abundances is crucial for an extremely broad range of topics.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We reassess the solar abundances of all 83 long-lived elements, using highly realistic solar modelling and state-of-the-art spectroscopic analysis techniques coupled with the best available atomic data and observations.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The basis for our solar spectroscopic analysis is a three-dimensional (3D) radiative-hydrodynamical model of the solar surface convection and atmosphere, which reproduces the full arsenal of key observational diagnostics. New complete and comprehensive 3D spectral line formation calculations taking into account of departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) are presented for Na, Mg, K, Ca, and Fe using comprehensive model atoms with reliable radiative and collisional data. Our newly derived abundances for C, N, and O are based on a 3D non-LTE analysis of permitted and forbidden atomic lines as well as 3D LTE calculations for a total of 879 molecular transitions of CH, C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, CO, NH, CN, and OH. Previous 3D-based calculations for another 50 elements are re-evaluated based on updated atomic data, a stringent selection of lines, improved consideration of blends, and new non-LTE calculations available in the literature. For elements where spectroscopic determinations of the quiet Sun are not possible, the recommended solar abundances are revisited based on complementary methods, including helioseismology (He), solar wind data from the Genesis sample return mission (noble gases), sunspot observations (four elements), and measurements of the most primitive meteorites (15 elements).{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our new improved analysis confirms the relatively low solar abundances of C, N, and O obtained in our previous 3D-based studies: log {\textless}i{\textgreater}ϵ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}C{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 8.46 ± 0.04, log {\textless}i{\textgreater}ϵ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}N{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 7.83 ± 0.07, and log {\textless}i{\textgreater}ϵ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}O{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 8.69 ± 0.04. Excellent agreement between all available atomic and molecular indicators is achieved for C and O, but for N the atomic lines imply a lower abundance than for the molecular transitions for unknown reasons. The revised solar abundances for the other elements also typically agree well with our previously recommended values, with only Li, F, Ne, Mg, Cl, Kr, Rb, Rh, Ba, W, Ir, and Pb differing by more than 0.05 dex. The here-advocated present-day photospheric metal mass fraction is only slightly higher than our previous value, mainly due to the revised Ne abundance from Genesis solar wind measurements: {\textless}i{\textgreater}X{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}surface{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.7438 ± 0.0054, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Y{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}surface{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.2423 ± 0.0054, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}surface{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.0139 ± 0.0006, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}surface{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}X{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}surface{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.0187 ± 0.0009. Overall, the solar abundances agree well with those of CI chondritic meteorites, but we identify a correlation with condensation temperature such that moderately volatile elements are enhanced by ≈0.04 dex in the CI chondrites and refractory elements possibly depleted by ≈0.02 dex, conflicting with conventional wisdom of the past half-century. Instead, the solar chemical composition more closely resembles that of the fine-grained matrix of CM chondrites with the expected exception of the highly volatile elements.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Updated present-day solar photospheric and proto-solar abundances are presented for 83 elements, including for all long-lived isotopes. The so-called solar modelling problem – a persistent discrepancy between helioseismology and solar interior models constructed with a low solar metallicity similar to that advocated here – remains intact with our revised solar abundances, suggesting shortcomings with the computed opacities and/or treatment of mixing below the convection zone in existing standard solar models. The uncovered trend between the solar and CI chondritic abundances with condensation temperature is not yet understood but is likely imprinted by planet formation, especially since a similar trend of opposite sign is observed between the Sun and solar twins.},

	abstract = {Theoretical studies suggest that C/O and Mg/Si are the most important elemental ratios in determining the mineralogy of terrestrial planets. The C/O ratio controls the distribution of Si among carbide and oxide species, while Mg/Si gives information about the silicate mineralogy. We present a detailed and uniform study of C, O, Mg, and Si abundances for 61 stars with detected planets and 270 stars without detected planets from the homogeneous high-quality unbiased HARPS GTO sample, together with 39 more planet-host stars from other surveys. We determine these important mineralogical ratios and investigate the nature of the possible terrestrial planets that could have formed in those planetary systems. We find mineralogical ratios quite different from those of the Sun, showing that there is a wide variety of planetary systems which are not similar to our solar system. Many planetary host stars present an Mg/Si value lower than 1, so their planets will have a high Si content to form species such as MgSiO3. This type of composition can have important implications for planetary processes such as plate tectonics, atmospheric composition, or volcanism.},

	abstract = {The super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cnc e, the smallest member of a five-planet system, has recently been observed to transit its host star. The radius estimates from transit observations, coupled with spectroscopic determinations of mass, provide constraints on its interior composition. The composition of exoplanetary interiors and atmospheres are particularly sensitive to elemental C/O ratio, which to first order can be estimated from the host stars. Results from a recent spectroscopic study analyzing the 6300 Å [O I] line and two C I lines suggest that 55 Cnc has a carbon-rich composition (C/O = 1.12 ± 0.09). However, oxygen abundances derived using the 6300 Å [O I] line are highly sensitive to a Ni I blend, particularly in metal-rich stars such as 55 Cnc ([Fe/H] =0.34 ± 0.18). Here, we further investigate 55 Cnc's composition by deriving the carbon and oxygen abundances from these and additional C and O absorption features. We find that the measured C/O ratio depends on the oxygen lines used. The C/O ratio that we derive based on the 6300 Å [O I] line alone is consistent with the previous value. Yet, our investigation of additional abundance indicators results in a mean C/O ratio of 0.78 ± 0.08. The lower C/O ratio of 55 Cnc determined here may place this system at the sensitive boundary between protoplanetary disk compositions giving rise to planets with high ({\textgreater}0.8) versus low ({\textless}0.8) C/O ratios. This study illustrates the caution that must applied when determining planet host star C/O ratios, particularly in cool, metal-rich stars. The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

We have measured the intensity of 555 emission lines, many of them corresponding to permitted lines of different heavy‐element ions. This is the largest set of spectral emission lines ever obtained for a Galactic or extragalactic H ii region. We have derived He+, C2+, O+, O2+ and Ne2+ abundances from pure recombination lines. This is the first time that O+ and Ne2+ abundances have been obtained from these kinds of lines in the nebula. We have also derived abundances from collisionally excited lines for a large number of ions of different elements. In all cases, ionic abundances obtained from recombination lines are larger than those derived from collisionally excited lines. We have obtained remarkably consistent independent estimations of the temperature fluctuation parameter, t2, from different methods, which are also similar to other estimates from the literature. This result strongly suggests that moderate temperature fluctuations (t2 between 0.02 and 0.03) are present in the Orion nebula. We have compared the chemical composition of the nebula with those of the Sun and other representative objects. The heavy‐element abundances in the Orion nebula are only slightly higher than the solar ones, a difference that can be explained by the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood.},

These three high-z galaxies show the detection of several strong emission nebular lines, including the temperature-sensitive [O iii] λ4363 line, allowing us to directly determine the nebular conditions and abundances for O/H, C/O, and Ne/O. We derive O/H abundances and ionization parameters that are generally consistent with other recent analyses. We analyze the mass–metallicity relationship (i.e., slope) and its redshift evolution by comparing between the three z {\textgreater} 7 galaxies and local star-forming galaxies. We also detect the C iii] λλ1907, 1909 emission in a z {\textgreater} 8 galaxy from which we determine the most distant C/O abundance to date. This valuable detection of log(C/O) = −0.83 ± 0.38 provides the first test of C/O redshift evolution out to high redshift. For neon, we use the high-ionization [Ne iii] λ3869 line to measure the first Ne/O abundances at z {\textgreater} 7, finding no evolution in this α-element ratio. We explore the tentative detection of [Fe ii] and [Fe iii] lines in a z {\textgreater} 8 galaxy, which would indicate a rapid buildup of metals. Importantly, we demonstrate that properly flux-calibrated and higher-S/N spectra are crucial to robustly determine the abundance pattern in z {\textgreater} 7 galaxies with NIRSpec/JWST.},

	abstract = {The origin of the abundance discrepancy is one of the key problems in the physics of photoionized nebula. In this work, we analize and discuss data for a sample of Galactic and extragalactic HII regions where this abundance discrepancy has been determined. We find that the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) is fairly constant and of the order of 2 in all the available sample of HII regions. This is a rather different behaviour than that observed in planetary nebulae, where the ADF shows a much wider range of values. We do not find correlations between the ADF and the O/H, O++/H+ ratios, the ionization degree, Te(High), Te(Low)/ Te(High), FWHM, and the effective temperature of the main ionizing stars within the observational uncertainties. These results indicate that whatever mechanism is producing the abundance discrepancy in HII regions it does not substantially depend on those nebular parameters. On the contrary, the ADF seems to be slightly dependent on the excitation energy, a fact that is consistent with the predictions of the classical temperature fluctuations paradigm. Finally, we obtain that Te values obtained from OII recombination lines in HII regions are in agreement with those obtained from collisionally excited line ratios, a behaviour that is again different from that observed in planetary nebulae. These similar temperature determinations are in contradiction with the predictions of the model based on the presence of chemically inhomogeneous clumps but are consistent with the temperature fluctuations paradigm. We conclude that all the indications suggest that the physical mechanism responsible of the abundance discrepancy in HII regions and planetary nebulae are different.},
